Description: Non Sequencer is a real-time, pattern-based MIDI sequencer
 The Non Sequencer is a powerful real-time, pattern-based MIDI
 sequencer for Linux--released under the GPL. Filling the void left by
 countless DAWs, piano-roll editors, and other purely performance
 based solutions, it is a compositional tool--one that transforms MIDI
 music-making on Linux from a complex nightmare into a pleasurable,
 efficient, and streamlined process.
